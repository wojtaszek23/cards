### Short history of implementing and information about sources
At the beggining I was going to do front-end on vue.js framework, but it occured that it would demand connecting a lot of new knowledge in short time, which was impossible for me. Finally, after research and getting familiar with Laravel  I decided to use following [CRUD project](https://dev.to/kingsconsult/laravel-8-crud-bi9) tutorial solution shared by [Kingsconsult](https://github.com/Kingsconsult), then changed it for my own requirements, made some fixes and added pagination.
Additionaly I found well descripted pagination here:
